## 👩‍💻 Challenges

If you'd like to create a sandbox like mine, here's how you can get started:

1. [Fork and clone](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [AdyenCheckoutJS](https://github.com/adyen-examples/AdyenCheckoutsJS) repo. 
2. Open the [DROPIN_CHALLENGES.md](https://github.com/gaylem/adyen-checkout-sandbox/blob/main/DROPIN_CHALLENGES.md) file and work through the challenges listed there. 
3. Only reference the solutions in my repo if you get really stuck or want to check your work! 🦄
4. Review the Adyen docs and create your own challenges to better understand payment processing. 🌈
